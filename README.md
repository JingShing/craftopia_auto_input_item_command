# Usage
This script is helpful for the cheaters or researchers. This script can automatically help you to enter the command to summon items.

# What you need before start
Before started you will need to get these mod: [Craftopia Mod Loader (BepInEx)
](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2519948110), [ChatItem](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2527976538)

After get these mods you will get a item id list in txt in your game file folder if you active the game.

And if you also want enchant id you would need to get this mod: [EnchantMenu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2527137938)

It will also give you enchant id list.

# setting
In my script it will need a image to start which called "1.png". That is a random icon you need to get by yourself. In my case I choose the map button so my script can find this button and click it to focus on the window.
